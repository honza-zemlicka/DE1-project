### Abstract
This project focuses on creating a simple [pomodoro timer](https://pomofocus.io/) with FPGA board. Pomodoro technique is a time management method that breaks work times into intervals (usually 25 minutes long), followed by short breaks (5 minutes long). After 4 working intervals a long, 15 minute break, follows. This technique is used to improve focus & productivity by balancing working intervals with regular rest times.

Our project aims to have two modes - classic & custom. Classic mode will use default timer settings of 25-5-15. With custom mode, the user will be able to set up their own time intervals using switches.
