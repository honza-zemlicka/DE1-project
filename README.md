### Abstract
This project focuses on creating a simple [pomodoro timer](https://pomofocus.io/) with FPGA board. Pomodoro technique is a time management method that breaks your work into intervals (usually 25 minutes long), followed by short breaks (5 minutes long). After 4 working intervals a longer break follows (15 minutes). This technique is used to improve focus & productivity by balancing working intervals with regular rest times.

Our project aims to implement this simple timer onto Nexys A7-50T board.
