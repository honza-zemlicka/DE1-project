### Abstract
This project focuses on creating a simple [pomodoro timer](https://pomofocus.io/) with Nexys A7-50T FPGA board. Pomodoro technique is a time management method that breaks your work into intervals (usually 25 minutes long), followed by short breaks (5 minutes long). After 4 working intervals a longer break follows (15 minutes). This technique is used to improve focus & productivity by balancing working intervals with regular rest times.

## Hardware description of demo application

When launching the device, the user finds themselves in idle mode, indicated by LED16 which lights up blue. 

## Software description

Put flowchats/state diagrams of your algorithm(s) and direct links to source/testbench files in `src` and `sim` folders.
